<center style="color: coral;"><h1>Biryani</h1>
<img src="bri.png"></center>
<br><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<p>basmati rice, meat (chicken, mutton, or beef), onions, yogurt, tomatoes, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, mint leaves, cilantro, and a blend of aromatic spices like cardamom,
    cloves, cinnamon, and saffron, ghee, turmeric, red chili powder, and fried onions.</p>
<br><h3>Procedure:</h3>
<p>Chicken, mutton, or vegetables are marinated in yogurt or other liquid, along with a blend of spices like ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, and coriander powder.
This step helps tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor.
Basmati rice is rinsed and soaked, which helps it achieve a fluffy texture. 
The rice is then cooked separately, either in a pot or pressure cooker, with a slightly salty water base. 
A heavy-bottomed pan or casserole is used for layering. 
A layer of rice is placed, followed by a layer of marinated meat or vegetables, and then more rice. 
This layering can be repeated. 
Fried onions, mint, coriander, and saffron milk (or water) are often added for flavor and aroma. 
The pan is covered tightly with foil or a cloth to trap steam and cook the biryani on low heat. 
This "dum" or steaming process allows the flavors to meld together.  
After steaming, the biryani is allowed to rest for a while to allow the flavors to settle.
Finally, the chicken and rice are mixed gently to ensure even distribution of flavors.</p>
